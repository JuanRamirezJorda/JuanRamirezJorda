# Welcome to my portfolio


### I am Juan, I am 25 years old. Graduated in Electrical engineering from the Polytechnic University of Valencia in 2021 and in 2022  in the Msc. of Quantitative Finance at AFI School of Finance. 
### Since 2016-17, the financial markets has generated in me a lot of interest for its human behaviour and technological character. As a result, I have learned over the years from the resources offered by the internet on various platforms about economics, markets and so on. After my first personal experiences testing myself on different platforms with real trading experiences, I decided to join the UPV Investment Club as an analyst, participating in the operations and in different events. Afterwards, I enrolled in the Msc to acquire the necessary practical skills to become part of the industry in a large investment firm.     
### 🔎 My main objectives in these first years of my career are to master the programming languages with the most long-term presence in this sector and specialise in a particular product/underlying asset, having a fairly deep knowledge and application in the real economy. 

##### 💻 Currently working on several projects: ETF C&R app, Bootcamp: Futures/Algo trading via Quantconnect
##### 👉🏽 My plan consist on posting the projects as soon as I reasonably consider it appropriate.
